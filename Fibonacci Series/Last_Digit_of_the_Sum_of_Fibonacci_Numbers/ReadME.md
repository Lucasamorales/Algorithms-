# Last Digit of Fibonacci Sum Calculator

## Problem Statement
This script computes the last digit of the sum of the Fibonacci sequence from $\( F_0 \)$ to $\( F_n \)$. This is a useful computation in many areas of computer science and mathematics, especially when dealing with large sequences where only the last digit is of interest.

**Input**: An integer `n`.  
**Output**: The last digit of the sum $\( F_0 + F_1 + \ldots + F_n \)$ modulo 10.

**Constraints**:
- $\(0 \leq n \leq 10^{14}\)$

## Understanding the Problem
The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. As you can imagine, these numbers get very large very quickly. For example, while the 10th Fibonacci number is just 55, the 100th is a 21-digit number!

When tasked with finding the sum of the first $\( n \)$ Fibonacci numbers, the direct computation becomes impractical because of these huge numbers. Imagine adding up 100 such massive numbers; not only would this be slow, but it would also demand a lot of computer memory.

However, for many applications, including some in cryptography and computational theory, we often only need the last digit of such a sum. This simplifies our problem: we don't need to work with the entire number, just its last digit. This is where 'modular arithmetic' (math involving remainders) comes into play. By focusing only on the last digit, or computing the sum modulo 10, we ignore all but the final digit of each Fibonacci number.

Further simplification comes from an interesting property of Fibonacci numbers known as the "Pisano Period," which is the repeating cycle of Fibonacci numbers modulo some number. For the number 10, this cycle repeats every 60 numbers. This periodicity means that rather than summing up to $\( F_n \)$, we only need to calculate up to the 60th term at most, significantly cutting down the amount of work we have to do.

Understanding these properties helps us tackle an otherwise daunting task, breaking down a potentially exponential problem into something manageable with a predictable pattern.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Compute Last Digit of Individual Fibonacci Number
This function computes the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number efficiently:
```python
def last_digit_fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n  # Directly return n for 0 or 1
    previous, current = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        previous, current = current, (previous + current) % 10  # Only keep the last digit
    return current
```
-   Explanation: We use a loop to iteratively compute the Fibonacci sequence but only keep the last digit to avoid large number calculations.

### Step 2: Calculate Last Digit of Sum of Fibonacci Numbers

Leverage the fact that the sum of the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers is related to the $(n+2)$-th Fibonacci number:

```python


def last_digit_of_fibonacci_sum(n):
    last_digit = last_digit_fib((n + 2) % 60)  # Compute last digit of F(n+2) using reduced n
    return (last_digit - 1) % 10  # Adjust for the sum formula and ensure non-negative result`
```
-   Explanation: The sum formula $F_0​+F_1​+...+F_n​=F_n+2​-1$ simplifies our calculation. The modulo 60 reduction is based on the Pisano period of 10, which is 60, reducing computational steps.

Complexity
----------

-   Time Complexity: $O(1)$ --- With the Pisano period optimization, we achieve constant time complexity.
-   Space Complexity: $O(1)$ --- We use a minimal, constant amount of space.
