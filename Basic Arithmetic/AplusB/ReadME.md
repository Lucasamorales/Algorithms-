# AplusB Calculator

## Problem Statement
This script performs the addition of two integers. It reads two numbers from the standard input and prints their sum.

**Input**: Two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.  
**Output**: The sum of `a` and `b`.

**Constraints**:
- Input values can be within the range of standard 32-bit integers.

## Understanding the Problem
The task is straightforward, involving basic arithmetic operations which are fundamental in programming. The challenge here is minimal, focusing mainly on proper input handling and output.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Read Input
```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read()
tokens = input.split()
```

-   Explanation: Reads input from the standard input (usually provided through redirection in a command line) and splits the input string into tokens based on whitespace.

### Step 2: Parse the Input

```python



a = int(tokens[0])
b = int(tokens[1])
````
-   Explanation: Converts the first two tokens from the split input into integers, assuming the input format is correct and there are at least two tokens available.

### Step 3: Compute and Print the Result

```python

print(a + b)

-   Explanation: Outputs the sum of the two integers.
```
Complexity
----------

-   Time Complexity: $O(1)$ --- The operation is a constant time operation as it involves a single addition, regardless of the input size.
-   Space Complexity: $O(1)$ --- Uses a constant amount of space, storing only the two integers and intermediate variables.
