Python Algorithms for Practice and Interview Preparation
========================================================

Welcome to my collection of algorithmic challenges and solutions in Python! This repository is a personal project aimed at brushing up on fundamental programming concepts and preparing for technical interviews.

About This Repository
---------------------

As I relearn and review key concepts in computer science, I am documenting my journey through Python algorithms. Each algorithm in this repository is accompanied by:

-   Detailed explanations: To understand the logic and approach behind the solutions.
-   Complexity analysis: With Big O notation to evaluate the performance.

This resource is not only a refresher for old concepts but also a toolkit for those preparing for software engineering interviews.

What You'll Find in This Repository
-----------------------------------

The repository is organized by categories such as sorting algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, etc. Here's what each directory typically includes:

-   Code: A Python script implementing the algorithm.
-   README: An explanation of the algorithm, its use-cases, and its runtime and space complexities.
